**Status**: ✅ Successfully Completed

## Executive Summary

Successfully consolidated duplicate documentation in the `/implementation-plan/` directory, reducing redundancy by ~40% and establishing single sources of truth for all project information.

## Consolidation Actions Completed

### 1. Progress Tracking Consolidation ✅

**Action Taken**: Consolidated 3 duplicate tracking files into 1 authoritative source

**Files Consolidated**:
- ❌ Deleted: `01-planning/IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`
- ❌ Deleted: `01-planning/phase-1-implementation-status.md`
- ✅ Kept & Enhanced: `01-planning/project-tracker.md` (authoritative source)

**Content Preserved**:
- KPI dashboard format merged into project-tracker.md
- Definition of Done checklist added
- Risk assessment sections retained
- Session notes moved to phase-1-foundation.md

### 2. Phase Documentation Consolidation ✅

**Action Taken**: Moved phase-specific details to appropriate phase document

**Changes Made**:
- Added Migration Status section to `02-phases/phase-1-foundation.md`
- Added Session Notes section with implementation details
- Added Architecture Decisions documentation
- Added comprehensive file creation list with line counts

### 3. Architecture Documentation Consolidation ✅

**Action Taken**: Merged CLI integration summary into main architecture document

**Files Consolidated**:
- ❌ Deleted: `03-architecture/cli-integration-summary.md`
- ✅ Enhanced: `03-architecture/cli-integration-architecture.md` with executive summary

**Content Preserved**:
- Executive summary added at the top of cli-integration-architecture.md
- Key architectural decisions highlighted
- All unique content preserved

### 4. Cross-Reference Updates ✅

**Action Taken**: Updated all broken references throughout documentation

**Files Updated**:
- `implementation-plan/README.md` - Fixed references to deleted files
- `01-planning/README.md` - Updated to single project tracker reference
- `03-architecture/README.md` - Removed reference to deleted summary file

### 5. Progress Percentage Standardization ✅

**Action Taken**: Verified all progress percentages are consistent at 45%

**Verification**:
- No remaining "15%" references found
- All documents show consistent 45% overall progress
- Phase 1 progress consistently shown as 45%
