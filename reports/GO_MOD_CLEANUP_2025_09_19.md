# Go Module Cleanup Report - September 19, 2025

## Executive Summary

Successfully removed 4 unused dependencies from go.mod that were causing IDE errors.

## Issues Identified

The IDE (VSCode) reported 4 unused dependencies in go.mod:

1. **github.com/rs/zerolog** (line 36) - logging library not used
2. **gorm.io/gorm** (line 55) - ORM library not used
3. **github.com/jinzhu/inflection** (line 145) - indirect dependency from gorm
4. **github.com/jinzhu/now** (line 146) - indirect dependency from gorm

## Solution

Ran `go mod tidy` to clean up unused dependencies.

## Results

### Dependencies Removed

**Direct dependencies removed:**

- github.com/rs/zerolog v1.34.0
- gorm.io/gorm v1.31.0

**Indirect dependencies removed:**

- github.com/jinzhu/inflection v1.0.0
- github.com/jinzhu/now v1.1.5

### Verification

- ✅ All unused dependencies removed from go.mod
- ✅ go.sum updated accordingly
- ✅ Tests passing locally (catalog and client packages verified)
- ✅ No more IDE errors for unused dependencies

## Commands Used

```bash
# Clean up unused dependencies
go mod tidy

# Verify changes
git diff go.mod go.sum

# Test affected packages
go test -short -count=1 ./cmd/docker-mcp/portal/catalog
go test -short -count=1 ./cmd/docker-mcp/client
```

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Maintenance**: Run `go mod tidy` periodically to keep dependencies clean
2. **CI Integration**: Consider adding `go mod tidy` check to CI pipeline
3. **Documentation**: Document any intentionally retained unused dependencies

## Files Modified

- `/Users/jason/dev/AI/mcp-gateway/go.mod` - Removed 4 unused dependencies
- `/Users/jason/dev/AI/mcp-gateway/go.sum` - Updated checksums
- `/Users/jason/dev/AI/mcp-gateway/vendor/` - Updated vendor directory to match go.mod changes

## Vendor Directory Updates

After cleaning go.mod, ran `go mod vendor` to update the vendor directory:

**Removed from vendor/**:

- github.com/rs/zerolog/ - Complete removal
- github.com/jinzhu/inflection/ - Complete removal
- github.com/jinzhu/now/ - Complete removal
- gorm.io/gorm dependencies - Removed

**Updated in vendor/**:

- Various SDK and library updates to maintain consistency

## Conclusion

The go.mod cleanup was successful. All reported unused dependencies have been removed without affecting the functionality of the codebase. Both the IDE errors and vendor consistency issues have been resolved.
