# AGENTS.md Update Complete

**Date**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: ✅ Successfully Updated

## Summary

Successfully updated AGENTS.md to reflect the new implementation-plan directory structure and removed all references to deleted/consolidated files.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure Update ✅

Updated the project structure documentation to show the new subdirectory organization:

```
implementation-plan/
├── 01-planning/      # Progress tracking and project management
├── 02-phases/        # Phase-by-phase implementation plans
├── 03-architecture/  # Technical specifications and design
├── 04-guides/        # Development and deployment guides
└── ai-assistant-primer.md  # AI context document
```

### 2. Fixed Broken Links ✅

**Updated References**:

- `portal-cli-integration.md` → `03-architecture/cli-command-mapping.md`
- `cli-integration-architecture.md` → `03-architecture/cli-integration-architecture.md`
- `technical-architecture.md` → `03-architecture/technical-architecture.md`
- `cli-command-mapping.md` → `03-architecture/cli-command-mapping.md`
- `database-schema.md` → `03-architecture/database-schema.md`
- `api-specification.md` → `03-architecture/api-specification.md`
- `deployment-without-docker-desktop.md` → `04-guides/deployment-without-docker-desktop.md`
- `deployment-guide.md` → `04-guides/deployment-guide.md`

### 3. Removed References to Deleted Files ✅

No longer referencing:

- `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` (deleted, merged into project-tracker.md)
- `phase-1-implementation-status.md` (deleted, merged into phase-1-foundation.md)
- `cli-integration-summary.md` (deleted, merged into cli-integration-architecture.md)
- `frontend-implementation.md` (never existed)
- `backend-implementation.md` (never existed)
- `database-design.md` (never existed)
- `portal-cli-integration.md` (never existed)

### 4. Updated Documentation Sections ✅

**Phase-Based Documentation**:

- Updated all phase references to use new subdirectory paths
- Organized by criticality (Critical/Important/Optional)
- Aligned with actual existing files

**When to Reference Documentation**:

- Added explicit directory paths for phase documents
- Updated all architecture references to `03-architecture/`
- Updated all guide references to `04-guides/`

## Verification Results

### Link Validation ✅

All updated links verified to exist:

- ✅ implementation-plan/README.md
- ✅ implementation-plan/ai-assistant-primer.md
- ✅ implementation-plan/02-phases/
- ✅ implementation-plan/03-architecture/cli-command-mapping.md
