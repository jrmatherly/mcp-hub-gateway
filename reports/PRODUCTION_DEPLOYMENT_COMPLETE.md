### Network Security

- Isolated Docker networks
- No exposed ports except nginx (443/80)
- Internal service communication only
- TLS enforcement for external connections

### Access Control

- JWT RS256 authentication
- Azure AD integration
- Row-Level Security in PostgreSQL
- Session management with Redis
- Rate limiting on all endpoints

### Audit & Compliance

- Comprehensive audit logging
- 7-year retention for compliance (SOC2, GDPR)
- Encrypted log storage
- Tamper detection with checksums
- Real-time security monitoring

## Deployment Process Overview

### Prerequisites

- Linux system with systemd
