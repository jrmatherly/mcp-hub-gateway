# docker mcp catalog bootstrap

<!---MARKER_GEN_START-->
Create a starter catalog file with Docker Hub and Docker CLI server entries as examples.
This command extracts the official Docker server definitions and creates a properly formatted
catalog file that users can modify and use as a foundation for their custom catalogs.

The output file is standalone and not automatically imported - users can modify it and then
import it or use it as a source for the 'catalog add' command.
