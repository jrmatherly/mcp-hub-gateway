## Development Workflow & TDD Instructions

### Essential Commands for Development

All commands should be run from `/Users/masegraye/dev/docker/workspaces/catalog-management/mcp-gateway/`:

```bash
# Scoped Test-Driven Development Cycle
go test ./cmd/docker-mcp/commands           # Test specific package (fastest)
go test ./cmd/docker-mcp/...               # Test cmd tree (medium scope)
make test                                   # Test entire system (broadest scope)
make docker-mcp                            # Build and install binary (only after tests pass)
make lint-darwin                           # Run linting (only when implementation complete)

# Manual testing commands
./dist/docker-mcp --help                    # Verify binary works
./dist/docker-mcp catalog --help           # Check catalog commands
./dist/docker-mcp gateway run --help       # Check gateway flags
```

### TDD Development Process

**CRITICAL**: Follow this exact workflow with progressively broader scope:

#### 1. Red Phase - Write Failing Tests First

```bash
# Test just the specific package you're working on
go test ./cmd/docker-mcp/commands    # Example: testing feature commands
# Should show failing tests for new functionality
```

#### 2. Green Phase - Make Tests Pass

```bash
# Write minimal implementation to make tests pass
go test ./cmd/docker-mcp/commands    # Test same package again
# Should show all tests passing in that package
```

#### 3. Package Integration Test

```bash
# Test all related packages together
go test ./cmd/docker-mcp/...         # Test entire cmd tree
# Should show all tests passing across packages
```

#### 4. Full System Test

```bash
# Test the entire system
make test
# Should show all tests passing system-wide
```

#### 5. Build Phase - Verify Compilation

```bash
# Only build after all tests pass
make docker-mcp
# Should build successfully and install to ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-mcp
```

#### 6. Manual Verification

```bash
# Test the actual CLI functionality
./dist/docker-mcp [your-new-command] --help
# Verify your changes work as expected
```

#### 7. Refactor Phase (Optional)

```bash
# Improve code while keeping tests green
go test ./path/to/package    # Test specific package after changes
```

#### 8. Lint Phase (End of Implementation Only)

```bash
# Only run linting when feature is complete
make lint-darwin
# Should show 0 issues
```

### Test Categories & Strategy

#### Unit Tests (Primary Focus)

- **Location**: Tests should be in `*_test.go` files alongside implementation
- **Speed**: Fast (< 1 second per test file)
- **Focus**: Individual function/method behavior
- **Run Command**: `make test`

#### Integration Tests (Secondary)

- **Location**: `cmd/docker-mcp/integration_test.go` and similar
- **Speed**: Slower (requires Docker daemon)
- **Focus**: End-to-end command workflows
- **Note**: Some are skipped in normal `make test` runs

#### Manual Tests (Verification)

- **Purpose**: Verify CLI behavior matches expectations
- **When**: After successful build, before marking tasks complete
- **Focus**: User experience and error messages

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Test First**: Always write tests before implementation
2. **Small Steps**: Implement one small piece at a time
3. **Green Tests**: Never commit with failing tests
4. **Build Validation**: Only build after tests pass
5. **Manual Check**: Always verify CLI behavior manually
6. **Lint Last**: Only run linting when implementation is complete

### Error Handling Strategy

#### Test Failures

```bash
make test
# If tests fail, fix the code, don't skip tests
```

#### Build Failures

```bash
make docker-mcp
# If build fails, check compilation errors and fix
# Don't proceed to manual testing until build succeeds
```

#### Lint Failures (End of Development)

```bash
make lint-darwin
# Fix all linting issues before marking feature complete
```

### Baseline Verification ✅

The following baseline tests have been verified to work:

- `make docker-mcp` - Builds successfully
- `make test` - All existing tests pass
- `make lint-darwin` - 0 linting issues
- CLI functionality verified working

**Ready to begin TDD implementation following the above workflow.**

## 🧪 Test Strategy Overview

### Required Test Files for TDD Implementation

Each implementation section below specifies **TEST FIRST** requirements. These test files must be created with failing tests before writing implementation code:

| Component           | Test File                                         | Purpose                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Feature Management  | `cmd/docker-mcp/commands/feature_test.go`         | Test feature enable/disable/list commands      |
| Gateway Enhancement | `cmd/docker-mcp/commands/gateway_test.go`         | Test --use-configured-catalogs flag validation |
| Catalog Loading     | `cmd/docker-mcp/internal/catalog/catalog_test.go` | Test catalog precedence and loading logic      |
| Export Command      | `cmd/docker-mcp/catalog/export_test.go`           | Test export functionality and protection       |
| Command Visibility  | `cmd/docker-mcp/catalog/*_test.go`                | Test unhidden commands appear in help          |

### Test-First Workflow Reminder

```bash
# 1. Write failing tests first
go test ./cmd/docker-mcp/commands -v  # Should show failing tests

# 2. Write minimal implementation
go test ./cmd/docker-mcp/commands -v  # Should show passing tests

# 3. Test broader scope
go test ./cmd/docker-mcp/... -v      # Should show all integration tests pass

# 4. Test full system
make test                            # Should show all system tests pass

# 5. Build and verify
make docker-mcp                      # Should build successfully
```

## Quick Context for Claude Code Sessions

### What This Feature Does

Enable users to create and manage custom MCP server catalogs that automatically work with the gateway runtime, while maintaining backward compatibility with Docker Desktop through feature flag gating.

### Current Architecture Status

- ✅ **Catalog CRUD System**: Fully implemented by David Gageot (June-July 2025)
- ✅ **Multi-Catalog Gateway**: Implemented by Jim Clark (July 21, 2025)
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: All underlying systems exist and work
- ❌ **Integration Gap**: Gateway runtime ignores catalog management system
- ❌ **User Discovery**: Catalog management commands are hidden

### Implementation Strategy

**Feature Flag Approach**: Use Docker CLI's existing `features` config system to gate new functionality, ensuring Docker Desktop compatibility.

**Command Name**: `docker mcp catalog bootstrap <output-file-path>`

**Purpose**: Create a starter catalog file with Docker and Docker Hub server entries as examples, making it easy for users to understand the catalog format and get started with custom catalogs.

**🧪 TEST FIRST**: `cmd/docker-mcp/commands/bootstrap_test.go` ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **Write tests for bootstrap command**
  ```go
  // Test cases implemented:
  func TestBootstrapCatalogCommand(t *testing.T)        // ✅ Test successful bootstrap creation

  func TestBootstrapInvalidPath(t *testing.T)           // ✅ Test invalid output path handling
  func TestBootstrapDockerEntriesExtraction(t *testing.T) // ✅ Test Docker/DockerHub entry extraction
  ```

**Implementation Strategy**:

1. **Config loading**: Call `ReadConfigWithDefaultCatalog(ctx)` to load Docker catalog
2. **YAML reading**: Call `ReadCatalogFile("docker-mcp")` to get raw catalog YAML
3. **Struct parsing**: Unmarshal to `Registry` struct for Go data access
4. **Server extraction**: Extract `registry.Registry["dockerhub"]` and `registry.Registry["docker"]`
5. **Bootstrap generation**: Create new `Registry` with only extracted servers
6. **File creation**: Marshal to YAML and write standalone catalog file

**Expected User Workflow**:

```bash
# Create bootstrap catalog with Docker examples
docker mcp catalog bootstrap ./my-custom-catalog.yaml

# User modifies the file to add their own servers
# User can then import it
docker mcp catalog import ./my-custom-catalog.yaml

# Or use it as source for adding individual servers
docker mcp catalog add existing-catalog my-server ./my-custom-catalog.yaml
```

**Implementation Tasks**: ✅ ALL COMPLETED

- **27 comprehensive test cases** covering all functionality (Phase 1: 23 tests, Phase 2: 4 tests)
- **Full TDD implementation** with test-first development methodology
- **Container environment validation** - all tests pass in `make test`
- **End-to-End workflow validation** - complete bootstrap → add → export tested
- **Backward compatibility** - no changes to existing Docker Desktop workflows
- **Production-ready binary** - builds and installs successfully as Docker CLI plugin

**Key Achievements**:

- Users can now enable `configured-catalogs` feature and use custom catalogs alongside Docker's official catalog with full CLI management capabilities
- New users can quickly get started with the `bootstrap` command to understand catalog format and create starter files with real Docker server examples

## Key Implementation Notes

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Maintain Docker Desktop Compatibility**: Never change default behavior of `docker mcp gateway run`
2. **Feature Flag Gating**: All new functionality MUST be gated behind `configured-catalogs` feature
3. **Graceful Degradation**: System must work properly when config is inaccessible
4. **Clear User Communication**: Error messages must provide exact commands to fix issues

### Technical Constraints

1. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing command signatures and behaviors preserved
2. **Container Support**: Feature must work in container mode with proper volume mounts
3. **Performance**: Catalog loading must not significantly impact gateway startup time
4. **Security**: No privilege escalation or unsafe file operations

### Architecture Decisions Made

1. **Feature Flag System**: Use Docker CLI's existing `features` config approach
2. **Catalog Precedence**: Last-loaded-wins for server conflicts (Docker → Configured → CLI)
3. **Command Structure**: Add `--use-configured-catalogs` flag rather than change defaults
4. **Error Handling**: Fail-safe approach where config problems disable feature rather than break gateway

## Quick Start for New Claude Code Sessions

1. **Read the feature spec**: Start with `feature-spec.md` for complete context
2. **Check current status**: Review completed items in this checklist
3. **Start implementation**: Begin with Phase 1.1 (Feature Management System)
4. **Test thoroughly**: Each component must work in plugin, standalone, and container modes
5. **Maintain compatibility**: Docker Desktop behavior must never change

**Key Commands to Validate Success**:

```bash
# Phase 1: Configured catalogs workflow
docker mcp feature enable configured-catalogs
docker mcp catalog create my-servers
docker mcp catalog add my-servers test-server ./server.yaml
docker mcp catalog export my-servers ./backup.yaml
docker mcp gateway run --use-configured-catalogs
# Gateway should start with both Docker servers AND test-server available

# Phase 2: Bootstrap workflow for new users
docker mcp catalog bootstrap ./starter-catalog.yaml
# Creates file with Docker and DockerHub server examples
docker mcp catalog create custom-servers
docker mcp catalog add custom-servers dockerhub ./starter-catalog.yaml
# Copies Docker Hub server from bootstrap file to custom catalog

# Validate export protection
docker mcp catalog export docker-mcp ./should-fail.yaml
# Should fail with: "Cannot export official Docker catalog 'docker-mcp'"
```
